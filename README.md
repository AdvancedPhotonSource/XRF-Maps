# XRF-Maps

X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging typically involves the creation and analysis of 3D data sets, where at each scan position a full energy dispersive x-ray spectrum is recorded. This allows one to later process the data in a variety of different approaches, e.g., by spectral region of interest (ROI) summation with or without background subtraction, principal component analysis, or fitting. XRF-Maps is a C++ open source software package that implements these functions to provide a tool set for the analysis of XRF data sets. It is based on the MAPS software http://www.aps.anl.gov/Xray_Science_Division/Xray_Microscopy_and_Imaging/Software_and_Tools/maps.html
